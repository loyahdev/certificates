# Apple Enterprise Development and Code Signing Certificates
Thanks for coming here!
You can find almost all leaked enterprise certificates that are used to sign iOS apps.

All certificates here are all availble to use for any of your services and an API to download them will be released soon.

These took a long time to compile and update when each new certificate gets leaked. If you like this please consider donating at https://loyahdev.me
If you can't donate please star the repo so I can keep making useful iOS tools for everyone.
